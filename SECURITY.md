# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

1. Sensitive Data 4. Adda SECURITY.md file
 Never store credentials as code/config in GitHub. You should include a SEcURITY.md fÃ¤le that highlights security related Some good practices: information for your project. This should contain:
 1 Block sensitive data being pushed to GitHub by Disclosure policy.
 git-secrets or its likes as a git pre-commit hook. Define the procedure tor Whatap ho finds a sa security issue

 2 Break the build using the same tools. to contact and how. Consider HackerOne's community edition or simply a 'security@' email,.
 3 Audit for slipped secrets with GitRob or trufleHog.

 2. Removing Sensitive data Settings users should consider that would impact the security posture of deploying this project, such as HTTPS, authorisation
 If sensitive data made to a repo after all: and many others. 1 Invalidate tokens and passwords.
 Known security gaps & future enhancements.
 Remove the info and clear the GitHub history Security improvements you haven't gotten to yet. 2 (force push rewrite history). Inform users those security controls aren't in place, and perhaps
 suggest they contribute an implementation!
 3 Assess impact of leaked private info.
 For some great reference examples of SECURITY.md files,
 3. Tightly control access look at Aoache Storm and TensorFlow.
 Failures in security are often humans making bad decisions. 5. GitHub Apps
 Mandate the following practices for your contributors:
 Remember these apps are written by third-party developers,
 1 Require Two-factor authentication for all your GitHub accounts. not GitHub, Validate: 2 Never let users share GitHub accounts/passwords. 1 The application access rights.
 Any laptops/devices with access to your source code must be The author/organisation credibility. properly secured.
 3 Howgood is the app's security posture- a breach of
 4 Diligently revoke access from users who are no longer them gives attackers access to your code! working with you.
 Monitor changes in (i) and (ii) over time and consider using application access restrictions.
 Manage team access to data. Give contributors only access to what they need to do their work.
 6. Add Security testing to PRs
 Use GitHub hooks to check your PRs don't introduce new vulnerablities
 1 SonarCloud -code quality testing.
 2 CodeClimate- automated code reviews.
 3 Snyk- dependency vuln testing.
 7. Use the right GitHub offering
 If you don't want anybody to have access to your code (even GitHub), or if regulations require it, use GitHub Enterprise's on-prem offering.
 8. Rotate sSH keys and Personal Access Tokens
 GitHub access is typically done using SSH keys or personal user tokens (in lieu of a password, because you enabled 2FA!). But what happens if those tokens are stolen and you didn't know?
 Be sure to refresh your keys and tokens periodically, mitigating any damage caused by keys that leaked out.
 9. Create New Projects with Security in Mind
 When creating any project, develop it like an open source project. Don't rely on security by obscurity. You will:
 1 Write more defensively when you push code/data knowing anyone could see.
 2 Find it easier and safer if you decide to open source the proiect.
 10. Importing Projects
 Before importing a project into a public GitHub repo, fully audit the history for sensitive data, and remove it before adding to GitHub.
